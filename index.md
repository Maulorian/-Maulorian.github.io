# Alexandre de Pape Portofolio

Welcome to my portofolio.

There's nothing better than learning by doing, and the projects I've done have made me much more comfortable writing code.

## Project 1 : Connect 4 Monte Carlo Search Tree

This project consisted in learning how the _Monte Carlo Search Tree_ (MCTS) algorithm worked and implement in for the game Connect4.

I created a frontend with the Javascript library **pixi.js** that communicates with a backend written in Golang that I learned for the occasion.

Both parts were deployed the platform **Heroku**

## Project 1 : Tetris Clone

I love games, and I take blatant interest in thinking about how the first video games were made because their gameplay was so simple and so great at the same time. With Tetris, I was so intrigued by how the mechanics of the game worked, the collision, the rotation of the pieces that I decided to code my own.

First written in Java, I rewrote the code in Javascript and the HTML Canvas to be able to deploy in on the web.
