Welcome to my portofolio, here I present my projects

# Connect 4 Monte Carlo Search Tree

This project consisted in learning how the monte carlo search tree algorithm worked and implement in for the game Connect4.

I created a **Frontend** with the Javascript library **pixi.js** that communicates with a Backend written and Golang.

Both parts were deployed the platform **Heroku**
